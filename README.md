# Lilya-Helper.bat
Batch Script Tool with the goal for better and easier use of YT-DLP

# Warning
As it stands in 30/12/2025 the helper version 1.1 need some touch ups due to recent youtube changes and changes in yt-dlp

Which will soon be resolved in 1.2 which you can get the beta here https://github.com/FlowerSylveon/Lilya-Helper.bat/blob/Dev/Lilya-Helper-v1.2-beta.bat

It's in very WIP but as it stands it works as properly
